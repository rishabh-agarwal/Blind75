## Introduction

The Blind75 list of problems is curated to help you build a strong foundation in coding interviews. The problems span across various categories such as Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more. This repository provides solutions in Java, including explanations and code for each problem.

## Problem Categories

The problems are grouped into the following categories:

- **Arrays & Strings**
- **Linked Lists**
- **Stacks & Queues**
- **Trees & Graphs**
- **Dynamic Programming**
- **Backtracking**
- **Sorting & Searching**
- **Greedy Algorithms**
- **Mathematics & Bit Manipulation**

## Solutions

Each problem has a dedicated directory containing:

- **Problem Statement:** A brief description of the problem.
- **Solution Explanation:** A detailed explanation of the approach used to solve the problem.
- **Code:** The Java implementation of the solution.
- **Complexity Analysis:** Time and space complexity analysis of the solution.

You can navigate to each category and find the respective solutions.
